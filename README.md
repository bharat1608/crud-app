# CRUD Application with React and Axios

This is a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built with React, Axios, and Vite. It interacts with a mock API to manage user data.

## Features

- Display a list of users from the mock API
- Add a new user
- Edit an existing user
- Delete a user
- Responsive design

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 14 or above)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/crud-app.git
   cd crud-app


### Step 2: Commit Your Code with Clear Messages

Ensure each commit has a clear and descriptive message. For example:

- `Initial commit with Vite project setup`
- `Add NavBar component with navigation links`
- `Create Home page component`
- `Implement Users page with UserForm and UserList`
- `Add Axios for fetching and manipulating user data`
- `Style application for responsive design`
- `Add comments and documentation for all components`

### Step 4: Push to GitHub

1. Initialize a Git repository if you havenâ€™t already:
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
